## Getting Started

To get started with this project, first clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alflint/pwa-jate.git
npm run start # will install dependencies in ./client & ./server
```

The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## JATE

The application should now be up and running. When the text-editor loses focus, it will store the current version in IDB (IndexedDB) which is a client-side database API that is used by Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) to store and retrieve structured data.
